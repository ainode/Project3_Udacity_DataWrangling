This is the address to the link where I got the dataset for Toronto:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/metro-extracts.mapzen.com/toronto_canada.osm.pbf

Toronto is part of province of Ontario in Canada. it is on north shores of lake Ontario, part of great lakes. It covers 630.2 km² and 
is the fourth largest city in North America.

I chose this dataset because this is the city where I live and I am quite familiar with all aspects of living in Toronto. I think this
helps with auditing data and finding flaws. For instance I know that when people want to search for information on the City of Oshawa,
which is close to Toronto, they don't search for City of Oshawa. They just search for Oshawa. I know the language and different cultures
that are prevelant in the city, therefore if some information extracted from the element in the dataset does not correspond to what I
know about the city I can ditect it and find out if the dataset needs cleaning up or changing for more efficient retrieval of information.
